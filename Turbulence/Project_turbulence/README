create a list of points (x,y,z) in a *.dat format
	# how to create a *.dat list of points of a NACA profile?
	http://airfoiltools.com/airfoil/naca4digit
	then play around with it, then download a list of points as
	'Source dat files'
	from here, suppose we will work with the file NACA_5412.dat file
	Another way, is to 'extract' points, using 'webplotdigitalizer',
	I'll show this approach during our lecture

	anyways, you'll be capable of reading-converting *.dat x-y (i.e. 2D) points with the following command
	
convert *.dat to *.geo file, for GMSH meshing
	inspired and adapted from
	https://github.com/phizz82/aerofoildat2gmsh 

	python3 dat2gmsh2D2D.py INPUTFILE.dat

	You'll end up having a INPUTFILE.geo file.

convert *.geo in a *.stl file
	'naive approach'
		'export' as a STL, using default uptions
	problem: too low resolution!
	'improved approach': control 'meshing/resolution'
	inside 'gmsh', go to option->mesh->general->element size factor
	change the spatial resoltion, i.e. in how many elements per size to split geometrical features...
	then 'mesh':
		on the left-menu, click on 1D-mesh, then 2D mesh, wait...and enjoy the result.

Then, all other operations are inside the 'Allrun' script, as always :)

clean case
	
	./Allclean

prepare case
	
	./Allrun

launch application (in background...)
	nohup pisoFoam > log &

follow evolution of residuals in real time

	gnuplot Residuals

# compute A POSTERIORI yplus
once that a given computation has taken over, yplus can be computed as following...
pisoFoam -postProcess -funcs yPlus
